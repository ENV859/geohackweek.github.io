### Reading List

One of the overarching goals of geohackweek is to find useful geospatial data science tools, assess their use to the larger geo-community, and then make their mass adoption as easy as possible (through the actual geohackweek, tutorials that remain after the week, etc.) This list is the first effort to identify useful geo tools, and put them in one place.

####[ESRI GIS Tools for Hadoop](http://esri.github.io/gis-tools-for-hadoop/)
ESRI looks like it has developed some useful tutorials, and may be especially helpful to those that started out firmly in ESRI's ArcGIS world. ArcGIS is not opensource however, and involving costly licences doesn't

####[Spark Magellan](http://hortonworks.com/blog/magellan-geospatial-analytics-in-spark/)

Hortonworks has developed some an interesting tutorial using Uber data. It seems that the tools favor Scala but Python is also supported. 

There also is a great summary of why Magellan is needed, and what if offer over ESRI's GIS tools for Hadoop.
