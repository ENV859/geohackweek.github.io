    The University of Washington’s eScience Institute hosted its first <a href="https://geohackweek.github.io/"> Geohackweek</a> during November 14-18, 2016. Inspired by <a href="http://astrohackweek.org/2016/">AstroHackWeek</a> and <a href="https://neurohackweek.github.io/">Neurohackweek</a>, we combined tutorials with group work ("hacks") on computational projects in geospatial sciences. 

    Our event offered training in open source vector and raster processing, multidimensional array analysis, data visualization, remote dataset access and cloud technologies. We also emphasized collaboration and reproducibility through tutorials on Git/GitHub, Docker, Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks. During the week, participants designed projects that explored software to address global climate change, urban planning, ecosystem management and other geospatial science challenges. 

   The event was co-organized by Anthony Arendt (eScience Institute/Applied Physics Lab), Randy LeVeque (UW Applied Math), Rob Fatland and Amanda Tan (UW IT), Christina Bandaragoda, Nicoleta Cristea (Civil and Environmental Engineering), Allison Smith (UW School of Oceanography), Ben Hudson, Emilio Mayorga, Landung “Don” Setiawan and David Shean (Applied Physics Lab), Catherine Kuhn (School of Forest and Environmental Sciences), and Bernease Herman and David Beck (eScience Insitute).

    This year we were fortunate to welcome guest lecturers Tyler Erickson and Nicholas Clinton who demonstrated the capabilities of <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/">Google Earth Engine</a>, James Douglass from the <a href="http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/">Natural Capital Project</a> who provided tutorials on raster processing, and Ben Weinstein and Ian Rose who brought expertise in version control and Jupyter notebooks.  

    Material from the event is available online at our <a href="https://geohackweek.github.io">Geohackwee website</a> (links provided in the "schedule" section), and ongoing project work can be accessed on our <a href="https://github.com/geohackweek/geohackweek.github.io/tree/master/projects">GitHub page</a>.
