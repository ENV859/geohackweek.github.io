                <h2>About Geohackweek</h2>
                <p>Geohackweek is a 5-day workshop/tutorial/hackathon to be held at the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">University of Washington eScience Institute</a>. 
                Participants will learn about open source technologies used to analyze geospatial datasets. </p>
                
                <p>Mornings will consist of interactive lectures, and afternoon sessions will involve facilitated 
                exploration of datasets and software development.</p>
                
                <p>This format is inspired by <a href="http://astrohackweek.github.io/">astrohackweek</a>
                and <a href="http://neurohackweek.github.io">neurohackweek</a>, similar programs focused on astrophysics and neuorphysics.
                </p>

                <h2>Information for applicants</h2>
                <p>To best benefit from the program, participants are expected to have some experience with programming (e.g. Python or similar)
                and with analysis of geospatial data (e.g. remote sensing analysis, vector mapping, environmental modeling).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Accepted applicants will be asked to pay a fee of $75 upon final registration. This fee will include participation in the course, and snacks and beverages during the day for the duration of the course.
