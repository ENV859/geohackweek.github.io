                <h2>About Geohackweek</h2>
                <p>Geohackweek is a 5-day hands-on workshop in geospatial mapping and data science, 
                held at the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">University of Washington eScience Institute</a>. 
                Participants will learn about technologies used to analyze earth science data, and methods for making 
                their analysis shareable and reproducible.</p>
                
                <p>Morning sessions will be devoted to hands-on lectures and afternoon sessions will be devoted to 
                participant-directed activities: hackathon and breakout sessions on topics of interest</p>
                
                <p>This format is inspired by <a href="http://astrohackweek.github.io/">astrohackweek</a>
                and <a href="http://neurohackweek.github.io">neurohackweek</a>, similar programs focused on astrophysics and neuorphysics.
                </p>

                <h2>Information for applicants</h2>
                <p>To best benefit from the program, participants are expected to have some experience with programming 
                and with geospatial data (e.g., analysis of satellite imagery in scripting languages, such as Python, R, or similar).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Accepted applicants will be asked to pay a fee of $50 upon final registration.
