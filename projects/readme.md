# Project guidelines

Each project requires a brief project summary in the readme.md of each project folder. Here is a template for the project summary. You can view existing projects to see examples.

#### Project Title

_brief title describing the proposed work_

#### Collaborators on this project

_List all participants on the project. Choose one team member to act as project lead, and identify one geohack organizer as the data science lead._

#### The problem

_What real-world problem are you trying to address? Provide a few sentences. If this is a technical exploration of software or data science methods, explain why this work is important in a broader context._

#### Application Example

_List one specific application of this work._

#### Sample data   

_If you already have some data to explore, briefly describe it here (size, format, how to access)_

#### Project Ideas/Steps

_List the specific tasks you want to accomplish._

#### Existing methods

_How would you or others traditionally try to address this problem?_ 

#### Potential tools

_Building from what you learn at geohackweek, what new approaches would you like to try to implement?_

#### Background reading

_optional: links to manuscripts or technical documents for more in-depth analysis._
